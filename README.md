# Smart Attendance Web App

## 📚 Introduction

**Smart Attendance System** is a comprehensive, role-based college web application designed specifically for BCA students and teachers at **Bharati Vidyapeeth University (BVDU)**. The system digitizes and automates attendance management through QR code-based scanning with geofencing technology, ensuring accurate, secure, and real-time attendance tracking.

This modern web application provides separate login flows and dashboards for Students, Teachers, and Admins, with features including subject-wise attendance tracking, eligibility verification based on BVDU's 75% attendance rule, automated report generation, and complete BCA syllabus access.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional attendance systems in colleges face several challenges:

- **Manual attendance** is time-consuming and prone to errors
- **Proxy attendance** is a persistent issue affecting attendance integrity
- **Paper-based records** are difficult to manage, store, and retrieve
- **Lack of real-time tracking** prevents students from monitoring their attendance status
- **Manual calculation** of attendance percentages is tedious for teachers
- **Delayed reports** hinder timely intervention for at-risk students
- **Eligibility verification** for semester exams requires manual checking against university rules

These inefficiencies result in wasted time, inaccurate records, and poor student accountability.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

The Smart Attendance Web App addresses these challenges by providing:

- **QR Code-Based Attendance**: Teachers generate time-limited QR codes (valid for 5-10 minutes) that students scan to mark attendance
- **Geofencing Technology**: Location validation ensures students are physically present within the BVDU campus radius (Kharghar, Belpada, Sector 3)
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Instant attendance updates with color-coded status indicators (Green ≥75%, Yellow 70-74%, Red <70%)
- **Subject-Wise Tracking**: Separate attendance records for each subject with detailed analytics
- **Automated Reports**: Generate monthly and semester reports in Excel and PDF formats
- **Eligibility System**: Automatic calculation of semester exam eligibility based on 75% attendance rule
- **Student Management**: Complete admin interface for managing student records
- **Secure Authentication**: Role-based access control with device security features
- **BCA Syllabus Access**: Complete semester-wise syllabus (Semesters 1-6) available to students

- 🌐 **Website**:# Smart Attendance Web App

## 📚 Introduction

**Smart Attendance System** is a comprehensive, role-based college web application designed specifically for BCA students and teachers at **Bharati Vidyapeeth University (BVDU)**. The system digitizes and automates attendance management through QR code-based scanning with geofencing technology, ensuring accurate, secure, and real-time attendance tracking.

This modern web application provides separate login flows and dashboards for Students, Teachers, and Admins, with features including subject-wise attendance tracking, eligibility verification based on BVDU's 75% attendance rule, automated report generation, and complete BCA syllabus access.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional attendance systems in colleges face several challenges:

- **Manual attendance** is time-consuming and prone to errors
- **Proxy attendance** is a persistent issue affecting attendance integrity
- **Paper-based records** are difficult to manage, store, and retrieve
- **Lack of real-time tracking** prevents students from monitoring their attendance status
- **Manual calculation** of attendance percentages is tedious for teachers
- **Delayed reports** hinder timely intervention for at-risk students
- **Eligibility verification** for semester exams requires manual checking against university rules

These inefficiencies result in wasted time, inaccurate records, and poor student accountability.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

The Smart Attendance Web App addresses these challenges by providing:

- **QR Code-Based Attendance**: Teachers generate time-limited QR codes (valid for 5-10 minutes) that students scan to mark attendance
- **Geofencing Technology**: Location validation ensures students are physically present within the BVDU campus radius (Kharghar, Belpada, Sector 3)
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Instant attendance updates with color-coded status indicators (Green ≥75%, Yellow 70-74%, Red <70%)
- **Subject-Wise Tracking**: Separate attendance records for each subject with detailed analytics
- **Automated Reports**: Generate monthly and semester reports in Excel and PDF formats
- **Eligibility System**: Automatic calculation of semester exam eligibility based on 75% attendance rule
- **Student Management**: Complete admin interface for managing student records
- **Secure Authentication**: Role-based access control with device security features
- **BCA Syllabus Access**: Complete semester-wise syllabus (Semesters 1-6) available to students
